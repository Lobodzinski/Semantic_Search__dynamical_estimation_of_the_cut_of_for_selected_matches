## Semantic Search: dynamical estimation of the threshold value of similarities for selected pairs of queries 
### Topic:
semantic search (symmetric and asymmetric)

### Description:
The provided code (_Semantic_Search__dynamical_estimation_of_the_cut_of_for_selected_matches.ipynb_) shows how we can determine the acceptance threshold in the created set of matched query pairs. The problem of such estimation becomes very important when the texts being compared are significantly different in length and/or contain significantly different degrees of content. In other words, the problem becomes severe when one is dealing with so-called asymmetric semantic search 
(_https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/semantic-search/README.html#symmetric-vs-asymmetric-semantic-search_).
 This method can determine the final solution or be a prelude to a more modified version of it.
